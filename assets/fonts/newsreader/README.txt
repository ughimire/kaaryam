Hello Artur,
Thank you for your login details.
We checked the site and it seems like the PHP version is outdated. Information is displayed on 
https://orisha.dev/wp-admin/


Latest WordPress requires PHP 7.4 to properly run. This led to the issue of not being able to activate plugins into the site.


Please contact your hosting provider to upgrade your PHP version. Once done we can continue with import.

Thank you!

Hello Orisha,
Thank you for your login details but we would require a website address and also FTP address for importing. Can you send both and we will start the import process.

Thank you!
